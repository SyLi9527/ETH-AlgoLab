* Algorithms Lab 2018
This repo contains my solutions to the algorithms lab of ETH ZÃ¼rich. The lab consists of problems every week that must be solved via an algorithm. 

The primary language to solve the challenges is C++. I strive as much as possible to document my code and my algorithms. The description of the problems may be wonky, so I suggest that you give the associated PDF a read for a detailed explanation of the problem.

** Compilation and Running
*** STL/BGL Files
To compile the cpp files:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
g++ -Wall -O3 filename.cpp -o filename.o
#+END_SRC

To run the file with a given input and redirect output to a file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./filename.o < testsets/test{i}.in > test{i}.out
#+END_SRC

To compare with the expected output, use `diff`
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
diff test{i}.out testsets/test{i}.out
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, you can do the previous in one line
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
diff <(./filename.o < testsets/test{i}.in) testsets/test{i}.out
#+END_SRC

*** CGAL
Compiling CGAL files is slightly different, it makes use of the ~cgal_create_cmake_script~.
In order to avoid to seperate the source code from compiled files, take advantage of an additional build folder.
Compile as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cgal_create_cmake_script
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
#+END_SRC

To run, the procedure is the same as for STL/BGL files.
